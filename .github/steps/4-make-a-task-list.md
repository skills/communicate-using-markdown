## Step 4: Make a task list

_Great job adding a code example to the file :partying_face:_

**What is a _task list_?** A task list creates checkboxes to check off. They're very useful for tracking issues and pull requests. If you include a task list in the body of an issue or pull request, you'll see a progress indicator in your issue list. The syntax for task lists is very specific. Be sure to include the spaces where required, or else they won't render.

### Example

```
- [x] List syntax is required
- [x] This item is complete
- [ ] This item is not complete
```

#### How it looks

- [x] List syntax is required
- [x] This item is complete
- [ ] This item is not complete

### :keyboard: Activity: Add a task list

GitHub Actions went ahead and made a branch for you. So you'll need to add to the file we've created in the branch, and we will check your work as you work through this course!

1. Return to your pull request.
1. Use Markdown to create a task list. Here is an example:

   ```md
   - [ ] Turn on GitHub Pages
   - [ ] Outline my portfolio
   - [ ] Introduce myself to the world
   ```

   Remember, a task list starts with the syntax `- [ ]` and then the task list item. The formatting is specific!

1. Use the **Preview** tab to check your Markdown formatting.
1. Commit the changes to the file.
1. Wait about 20 seconds then refresh this page (the one you're following instructions from). [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) will automatically update to the next step.
