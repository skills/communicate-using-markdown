## Step 1: Add headings

**What is _Markdown_?** Markdown is a [lightweight syntax](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) for communicating on GitHub. You can format text to add a heading, lists, **bold**, _italics_, tables, and many other stylings. You can use Markdown in most places around GitHub such as:

- Comments on [issues](https://docs.github.com/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/about-issues), [pull requests](https://docs.github.com/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests), and [discussions](https://docs.github.com/discussions/collaborating-with-your-community-using-discussions/about-discussions)
- Files with the `.md` or `.markdown` extension
- Snippets of text in [Gists](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/editing-and-sharing-content-with-gists/creating-gists)

**What is a _heading_?** A heading is a larger bit of text at the beginning of a section. There are six sizes.

### Example

```md
# This is an `<h1>` heading, which is the largest

## This is an `<h2>` heading

###### This is an `<h6>`heading, which is the smallest
```

# This is an `<h1>` heading, which is the largest

## This is an `<h2>` heading

###### This is an `<h6>` heading, which is the smallest
