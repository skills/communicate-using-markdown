## Step 2: Make a list

Markdown supports 3 types of common lists. They include:

- [Unordered](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax#lists) - Bulleted list
- [Ordered](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax#lists) - Number list
- [Task](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax#task-lists) - Checkbox list

### Unordered list

An unordered list is simple to show. Each item is placed on its own line using a `-`, `*`, or `+` character.

```md
- Item 1
- Item 2
- Item 3
```

- Item 1
- Item 2
- Item 3

### Ordered List

A list is changed to ordered by using any number instead of the list character. Notice how markdown automatically handles the counting. Nice!

```md
1. Step 1
1. Step 2
1. Step 3
```

1. Step 1
1. Step 2
1. Step 3

### Task List

A task list is extends the unordered list to use check boxes.
Add empty brackets `[ ]` for incomplete tasks and filled brackets `[x]` for complete tasks. Note: The empty required space for empty brackets.

```md
- [x] This task is complete
- [ ] This task is not complete
```

- [x] This task is complete
- [ ] This task is not complete

> [!TIP]
> Issues and pull requests can use task syntax for [conveying progress](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/about-tasklists).
