## Step 1: Add headers

_Welcome to "Communicate using Markdown"! :wave:_

**What is _Markdown_?** Markdown is a [lightweight syntax](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) for communicating on GitHub. You can format text to add a heading, lists, **bold**, _italics_, tables, and many other stylings. You can use Markdown in most places around GitHub:

- Comments on [issues](https://docs.github.com/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/about-issues), [pull requests](https://docs.github.com/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests), and [discussions](https://docs.github.com/discussions/collaborating-with-your-community-using-discussions/about-discussions)
- Files with the `.md` or `.markdown` extension
- Sharing snippets of text in [Gists](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/editing-and-sharing-content-with-gists/creating-gists)

**What is a _header_?** A header is a larger bit of text at the beginning of a section. There are six sizes.

### Example

```md
# This is an `<h1>` header, which is the largest

## This is an `<h2>` header

###### This is an `<h6>` header, which is the smallest
```

#### How it looks

# This is an `<h1>` header, which is the largest

## This is an `<h2>` header

###### This is an `<h6>` header, which is the smallest

### :keyboard: Activity: Edit your file with headers

1. Open a new browser tab, and work on the steps in your second tab while you read the instructions in this tab.
1. Open the **pull requests** tab.
1. Click **New pull request**, for the branches to compare, select `base: main` and `compare: start-markdown`.
1. Click **Create pull request**.
1. In this pull request, go to the **Files changed** tab. We made an empty file `index.md` for you.
1. Select **Edit file** from the three dotted **...** menu in the upper right corner of the file view on `index.md`.
1. On the **Edit file** tab, add a `#`, followed by a **space**, before any content you like to make it an H1 Header. You can add more headers, using one to six `#` characters followed by a **space**.
1. Above your new content, click **Preview**.
1. At the bottom of the page, type a short, meaningful commit message that describes the change you made to the file.
1. Click **Commit changes**.
1. Wait about 20 seconds then refresh this page (the one you're following instructions from). [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) will automatically update to the next step.
