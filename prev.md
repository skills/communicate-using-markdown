GitHub is about more than code. It‚Äôs a platform for software collaboration‚Äîand Markdown is one of the most important ways developers can make their communication clear and organized in issues and pull requests.

This course will walk you through creating and using headings more effectively, organizing thoughts in bulleted lists, and showing how much work you‚Äôve completed with checklists. You can even use Markdown to add some depth to your work with the help of emoji, images, and links. See a word you don't understand? We've included an emoji üìñ next to some key terms. Click on it to see its definition.

## What you'll learn

In this course, you‚Äôll learn how to:

- Use Markdown to add lists, images, and links in a comment or text file
- Determine where and how to use Markdown in a GitHub repository

## What you'll build

## Welcome to your repository!

In this repository <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#repository)</sup>, you‚Äôll learn how to write with Markdown <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#markdown)</sup>, a simple and widely used markup language for formatting text. Here, you‚Äôll start building a static webpage for your customized portfolio.

### What is Markdown?

Markdown is a lightweight syntax for communicating on GitHub, and many other websites. You can format words as **bold** or _italic_, add images, and create lists. Markdown is regular text combined with a few non-alphabetic symbols, such as `#` or `*`. You can use Markdown with the formatting toolbar in issues <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#issues)</sup> and pull requests <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#pull-request)</sup>, or you can type the syntax.

You can use Markdown most places around GitHub:

- Comments in issues and pull requests (like this one!)
- Files with the `.md` or `.markdown` extension
- Sharing snippets of text in [Gists](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-gists)

For more information, see ‚Äú[Writing on GitHub](https://help.github.com/categories/writing-on-github/)‚Äù in the _GitHub Help_.

Let's get started!


## Step 1: Create a Task List

A task list creates checkboxes for people with access <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#collaborator)</sup>in a repository to check off. They're very useful for tracking issues and pull requests.

If you include a task list in the body of an issue or pull request, you'll see a progress indicator in your issue list. 

Watch out! The syntax for task lists is very specific. Be sure to include the spaces where required, or else they won't render.


#### Example markup

```
- [x] Additional markup is supported, including @mentions, #references, [links](url), **emphasis**, and <del>HTML tags</del>.
- [x] List syntax is required.
  - You can nest lists below, too!
- [x] This item is completed.
- [ ] This item is not complete.
```

#### Rendered

- [x] Additional markup is supported, including @mentions, #references, [links](url), **emphasis**, and <del>HTML tags</del>.
- [x] List syntax is required.
  - You can nest lists below, too!
- [x] This item is complete.
- [ ] This item is not complete.

### :keyboard: Activity: Add a comment

1. Add a comment to this issue, using Markdown to create a list of items to complete. Your task can include any tasks you wish, or you can use this example:

       - [ ] Turn on GitHub Pages
       - [ ] Outline my portfolio
       - [ ] Introduce myself to the world

1. Use the **Preview** tab to check your markdown formatting.
1. Click **Comment**.

For a printable version of the steps in this course, check out the [Quick Reference Guide]({{ host }}/public/{{ course.slug }}.pdf).

<h3 align="center">Watch below your comment for my response.</h3>

> _If you perform an expected action and don't see a response from me after a few seconds, refresh the page for your next steps._


I didn't see a task list in that comment. Remember, a task list starts with the syntax `- [ ] ` and then the task list item. The formatting is specific! Try again with a new comment. You can copy this one if you would like to see how they look:

```
- [ ] Turn on GitHub Pages
- [ ] Outline my portfolio
- [ ] Introduce myself to the world
```

If you would like assistance troubleshooting, create a post on the [GitHub Community]({{ communityBoard }}) board. You might also want to search for your issue to see if other people have resolved it in the past.

<h3 align="center">Watch below your comment for my response</h3>


{{ user.username }}, it looks like your task list has too many spaces between the `[ ]` square brackets.

The formatting for a task list requires that there is exactly one space between the brackets. When you check the box, that blank space will be replaced by an `x`.

Go ahead and try again!

### :keyboard: Activity: Add a task list

Add a comment to this issue. Use Markdown to create a task list of todo items. Here is an example:

```
- [ ] Turn on GitHub Pages
- [ ] Outline my portfolio
- [ ] Introduce myself to the world
```


## Step 2: Turn on GitHub Pages

### Nicely done @{{ user.username }}!

Now let's turn our focus to the content of your portfolio. Because this portfolio will display as a static web page, you'll need to enable GitHub Pages.

### :keyboard: Activity: Enable GitHub Pages
1. Under your repository name at the upper right, click [:gear: **Settings**]({{ repoUrl }}/settings).
2. Then on the lower left, click **Pages**
3. In the **GitHub Pages** section, use the **Select source** drop-down menu to select `main` as your GitHub Pages publishing source.
4. Click the **Save** button.
5. Read the page. Make no changes to the Theme. When ready under your repository name at the upper right click **Issues(1)**
6. Then click on **closed** 
7. Then click on "Getting Started with GitHub" issue and scroll down to find your last progress and instruction for the next step.

> _I may take up to a minute to respond as I wait for GitHub Pages to create a deployment of your repository_.

> _For more information, see [Configuring a publishing source for GitHub Pages](https://help.github.com/articles/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-github-pages/) in the GitHub Help._

<h3 align="center">Return to this issue for next steps.</h3>


## Step 3: Add headers

As you saw on your website, your portfolio doesn't have much content yet. We'll learn how to edit the file in this pull request to incorporate some Markdown headers.

You can see an example of a header at the top of this page! Just like in HTML, a header is a larger bit of text at the beginning of a section. There are six sizes.

#### Example

```
# This is an <h1> header, which is the largest
## This is an <h2> header
###### This is an <h6> header, which is the smallest
```

#### How it looks

# This is an `<h1>` header, which is the largest
## This is an `<h2>` header
###### This is an `<h6>` header, which is the smallest

In issues, pull requests, and comments, you can use the text formatting toolbar.

The toolbar isn't available everywhere. When you edit a file, you must type the `#` symbols manually.

### :keyboard: Activity: Edit your file with headers

{% if preferences.gitTool == 'cli' %}
1. Open your preferred command line interface, which we'll call your shell from now on.
1. Clone this repository:
      ```shell
      git clone {{ thePayload.repository.clone_url }}
      ```
1. Navigate to the repository in your shell:
      ```shell
      cd {{ thePayload.repository.name }}
      ```
1. Checkout to the branch in this pull request:
      ```shell
      git checkout add-headers
      ```
1. In your text editor of choice, open the file called `01-name.md`, in the `_includes` directory. On the first line, replace the text with your name, and add a `#` before the content to make it an H1 Header.
1. Save your file. Every time you make changes, it's a good idea to type `git status`. You should type this after you stage files, and after you commit. It's always a good idea!
1. Stage your file:
      ```shell
      git add _includes/01-name.md
      ```
1. Commit the change and add a commit message:
      ```shell
      git commit -m "<YOUR MESSAGE>"
      ```
1. Push your new commit to GitHub:
      ```shell
      git push
      ```
{% else %}
1. In this pull request, click the **Files changed** tab.
1. To edit the file titled `_includes/01-name.md`, click the **small pencil** ‚úèÔ∏è or select "Edit file" from the three dotted **...** menu in the upper right corner of the file view.
1. On the **Edit file** tab, add a `#`, followed by a **space**, before the content to make it an H1 Header. You can add more headers, using one to six `#` characters followed by a **space**.
1. Above your new content, click **Preview changes**.
1. At the bottom of the page, type a short, meaningful commit message that describes the change you made to the file.
1. Click **Commit changes**.
{% endif %}

<h3 align="center">Watch below for my response.</h3>


Take a look at your published site here: {{ url }}

As we add content throughout the course, this site will update.

I've closed this issue and opened a pull request for you to work on headers in your portfolio.

<hr>
<h3 align="center">Go to <a href="{{ prUrl }}">the pull request</a> now!</h3>


You've made a change to this file, but I don't see a header yet. Add another commit with a header. You can continue to make commits on a branch even after you open a pull request.

### :keyboard: Activity: Add a header

{% if preferences.gitTool == 'cli' %}
1. Open your preferred command line interface, which we'll call your shell from now on.
1. Clone this repository:
      ```shell
      git clone {{ thePayload.repository.clone_url }}
      ```
1. Navigate to the repository in your shell:
      ```shell
      cd {{ thePayload.repository.name }}
      ```
1. Checkout to the branch in this pull request:
      ```shell
      git checkout add-headers
      ```
1. In your text editor of choice, open the file called `01-name.md`, in the `_includes` directory. On the first line, replace the text with your name, and add a `#` before the content to make it an H1 Header.
1. Save your file.
1. Stage your file:
      ```shell
      git add _includes/01-name.md
      ```
1. Commit the change and add a commit message:
      ```shell
      git commit -m "<YOUR MESSAGE>"
      ```
1. Push your new commit to GitHub:
      ```shell
      git push
      ```
{% else %}
1. Click the "Files changed" tab.
1. Scroll to find the `_includes/01-name.md`.
1. Click the :pencil: pencil icon.
1. Add a header by including a `#` hash followed by a space.
1. Scroll to the bottom and commit your changes to your branch.
{% endif %}

## Step 5: Add an image

Now, you're going to add an image. You can add an image of yourself or anything else you'd like to feature. You'll also learn how to create descriptive text, or "alt text", for images, and how to create links.

### Images
Let's add an image. Don't forget to include descriptive text in the square brackets. This text is read aloud for people using screen readers. It's also shown at times when your image doesn't display, such as when there's a poor connection. You can see the syntax for images below:

```
![Image of Yaktocat](https://octodex.github.com/images/yaktocat.png)
```

## Step 6: Add a profile link

Your image looks great! Next, you'll want to add links to your awesome portfolio projects. Links help create context when you‚Äôre communicating in issues and pull requests.

You might link to a [website](https://github.com/), a [repository](https://github.com/github/training-kit), or even a [line of code](https://github.com/github/training-kit/blob/master/resources/learning-path/index.html#L32). To create a link, put the text you want to display in square brackets, and the URL in the following parentheses.

```
[GitHub](http://github.com)
```

## :keyboard: Activity: Add a link

{% if preferences.gitTool == 'cli' %}
1. In your shell, verify that you are currently checked out to the branch `add-images-links`:
      ```shell
      git status

## Step 8: Add a list

In this pull request, you'll learn about lists and emoji. You'll also list a few details in your resume.

:point_down: _These are expandable dialogues! Click to open and see more information._

<details>
  <summary>Emoji</summary>

  ### Emoji

  Emoji are fun :sparkles:, and they can be silly :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:, but they can also be an important communication tool when working with remote teams ‚úÖ. Tone doesn't come across as clearly when reading text as it comes speaking face to face, and emojis can be helpful in conveying context and emotions. :heart:

  Emoji are best used as additive extras, not replacements for text. With images, descriptive text makes it clearer for screen readers, but screen readers aren't guaranteed to convey the intent of an emoji. Make sure your meaning is clear in text, so emoji will help instead of causing more confusion.

  Here are some examples of popular emojis in markdown.

  | What you see | What you type |
  | ---------- | ------------ |
  | :heart:    | `:heart:`    |
  | :+1:       | `:+1:`       |
  | :smile:    | `:smile:`    |
  | :sparkles: | `:sparkles:` |
  | :tada:     | `:tada:`     |

  For more information about available emoji, [see this handy cheat sheet](https://gist.github.com/rxaviers/7360908). In most text fields on GitHub, you can type `:` and then begin to type the name of an emoji. A fuzzy search will bring up the 5 best guesses and let you select one.

  ![image of fuzzy search emojis on GitHub](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9906718/34602228-47cab148-f1ff-11e7-91f1-56d0fed702f0.png)
  <hr>
</details>


<details>
  <summary>Ordered Lists</summary>

  ### Ordered Lists

  Ordered lists have numbers. You can nest ordered lists within a list item by indenting them. You can read more about [formatting and syntax](https://help.github.com/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/) in the _GitHub Help_.

  ```
  1. Item 1
  2. Item 2
  3. Item 3
     1. Item 3a
     2. Item 3b
  ```

  1. Item 1
  2. Item 2
  3. Item 3
     1. Item 3a
     2. Item 3b

 <hr>
</details>

<details>
 <summary>Unordered Lists</summary>

  ### Unordered Lists

  To create an unordered list, use either the `-` or `*` character. As with ordered lists, you can nest a list by indenting two spaces.

  ```
  * Item 1
  * Item 2
    * Item 2a
    * Item 2b
  ```

  * Item 1
  * Item 2
    * Item 2a
    * Item 2b

## Step 9: Use emphasis

Great job with those lists! Let's try something new. You can use **bold** and _italic_ text in Markdown. There are a couple of ways to create emphasis.

```
*This text will be italic*
_This will also be italic_

**This text will be bold**
__This will also be bold__

_You **can** combine them_
```

### :keyboard: Activity: Add some _emphasis_

{% if preferences.gitTool == 'cli' %}
1. In your shell, verify that you are currently checked out to the branch `add-lists-emphasis`:
      ```shell
      git status
      ```
1. If you are _not_, then checkout to that branch:
      ```shell
      git checkout add-lists-emphasis
      ```
1. In your text editor of choice, open the file called `05-emphasis.md`, in the `_includes` directory. Add some information on your skills, including emphasis (like bold or italics).
1. Save your file.
1. Stage your new file:
      ```shell
      git add _includes/05-emphasis.md
      ```
1. Commit the change and add a commit message:
      ```shell
      git commit -m "<YOUR MESSAGE>"
      ```
1. Push your new commit to GitHub:
      ```shell
      git push
      ```
{% else %}
1. Edit the file `_includes/05-emphasis.md` in this pull request.
1. Use the **Preview** tab and your :sparkles: new Markdown knowledge, add emphasis (like bold or italics) to your skills.
1. Enter a short and descriptive commit message.
1. Commit your changes.
{% endif %}

:thinking: I don't see any text with emphasis yet. To complete this exercise, you need to add some emphasized text to the `_includes/05-emphasis.md` file, in the form of a *bold* or _italicized_ words.

1. Commit the change and add a commit message:
      ```shell
      git commit -m "<YOUR MESSAGE>"
      ```
1. Push your new commit to GitHub:
      ```shell
      git push
      ```
{% else %}
1. Click the "Files changed" tab.
1. Scroll to find the `_includes/05-emphasis.md`.
1. Click the :pencil: pencil icon.
1. Add emphasis using `**` for **bold** or `_` for _italics_ (emphasis should not have a space between the markdown and the word to be modified).
1. Scroll to the bottom and commit your changes to your branch.
{% endif %}

  <summary>Tables</summary>

   ### Tables

   You can create tables by assembling a list of words and dividing them with hyphens `-` (for the first row), and then separating each column with a pipe `|`:

    ```
    First Header | Second Header
    ------------ | -------------
    Content from cell 1 | Content from cell 2
    Content in the first column | Content in the second column
    ```

  First Header | Second Header
  ------------ | -------------
  Content from cell 1 | Content from cell 2
  Content in the first column | Content in the second column

  <summary>Inline Code Blocks</summary>

  ### Inline Code Blocks

  Certain words and phrases need to be formatted in monospace fonts, especially when writing about code. As you've seen throughout this lab, words can be distinguished in markdown with `inline code blocks`.

  Inline code is just one ``` character on either side of the text, and can be used within paragraphs, headers, or other Markdown.

  ```
  `inline code is just one backtick`
  ```

  `inline code is just one backtick`

  <summary>Separate Code Blocks</summary>

  ### Separate Code Blocks

  To separate out a larger block of code, use three ``` characters instead of one, and set the text aside in its own paragraph.

  What we type:
  
    ```
    Anything written in this **paragraph** will not be _formatted_ even if it would normally be recognized in this setting. :taco:
    ```

  ### Syntax Highlighting

  In addition to code blocks, some code blocks should be rendered differently depending on the language, such as Javascript or command-line text.

  What we type:

      ```sh
      github-learning-lab ~/Projects/recipe-repository
      $ git init
      Initialized empty Git repository in /Users/github-learning-lab/Projects/recipe-repository/.git/
      ```
